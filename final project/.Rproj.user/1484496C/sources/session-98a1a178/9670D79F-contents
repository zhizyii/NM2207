Hello! My name is Zhi Yi and I am a year 2 undergraduate majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a double minor in Data Analytics and Interactive Media Development at NUS.

This website serves as a documentation of my journey in **NM2207: Computational Media Literacy**, taken in AY23/24 Semester 1. On this webpage, I am excited to share my journey of learning the R programming language with you!

# Weekly Progress

In the Assignments page, I compiled all the Challenges and Code-alongs that I completed in NM2207 from weeks 1 to 9. The documents will be organized by week, where each week consists of a **Code-along**, where I followed coding practices from lecture videos, and a **Challenge**, where I completed coding questions. Feel free to explore my work!

In the Final Project page, I complied each week's documentation for the final project, from weeks 9 to 13.

# Conclusion

Thank you for visiting and following along with my journey! **\\ʕ ·ᴥ· ʔ/**
