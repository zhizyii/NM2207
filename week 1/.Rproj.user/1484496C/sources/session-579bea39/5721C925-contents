```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## running the csv file

```{r}
tv <- read.csv("../data/tv.csv") 
head(tv)
summary(tv)
```


1) What is the average commercial time of the basic tv cable? ( 2 d.p.)

```{r}
mean_basic <- mean(tv[tv$Cable == "Basic",2])
mean_basic
```


2) What is the standard deviation commercial time of the extended tv cable? (2 d.p.)

```{r}
sd_basic <- sd(tv[tv$Cable == "Extended",2])
sd_basic
```


3) Generate a visualization to compare the differences in commercial time between basic and extended tv cable. Comment on the visualization.

```{r}
ggplot(tv, aes(x = Times, fill = Cable)) + geom_histogram() +
      facet_wrap(~Cable)
```


4) Generate 10^4 bootstrap samples on the difference in mean times. Plot the distribution.
   What is the bootstrap mean and standard error?

```{r}


```


5) Obtain the 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval. Interpret this interval.

```{r}


```


6) What is the bootstrap estimate of the bias? What fraction of the bootstrap error does     this represent?

```{r}


```


7) Conduct a permutation test to see if the difference in mean commercial times is           statistically significant. State your conclusion.

```{r}


```










## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
